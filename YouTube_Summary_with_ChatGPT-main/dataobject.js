has ever reached out to us and an expressed interest but I created this series for a very specific reason we&#39;re not changing that so we&#39;re still gonna do it okay so welcome back to episode 10 of but better it so for those of you who don&#39;t live in Texas the honey butter chicken biscuit is one of the most coveted sandwiches in Texas fast food history it is something\"},{\"start\":\"43.14\",\"text\":\"that people here would consider unavoidable it&#39;s a um breakfast only item for some reason but water burger Whataburger reached out I will say really quickly that they have been very good sports so regardless of how this goes water burger if you&#39;re watching I appreciate you being so nice I think there&#39;s anything else that we really need to say about this other than let&#39;s make this shall we its water burger yeah it&#39;s actually what a burger everyone calls it water burger but I don&#39;t understand where they&#39;re\"},{\"start\":\"68.7\",\"text\":\"getting the extra are can I get for honey butter chicken biscuits there&#39;s nobody okay I just maybe the honey this is gonna be better one I can&#39;t tell if I genuinely can&#39;t tell if we&#39;re supposed to wait your water burger you&#39;re already losing points right now bro this is supposed to be fast food good hurry up the transaction was faster that&#39;s good it&#39;s time for what a burger this is a coveted comfy Texas thing so I&#39;ll try to be gentle you have to be as unbiased as possible it&#39;s hard for me to\"},{\"start\":\"98.22\",\"text\":\"be I got a lot of sandwiches come on now expecting it to look a little better I mean not saying that it looks it looks kind of it looks kind of sad I&#39;m scared to say this cuz I know the Texans are gonna get mad at me but like okay maybe the taste is better this is still hot okay we&#39;re like two minutes away from it so don&#39;t want to hear anything okay I mean the chickens not bad it&#39;s crispy barely any honey butter on this look at this falling apart the actual taste is good I mean like it&#39;s good but like this\"},{\"start\":\"124.469\",\"text\":\"is overripe I&#39;m sorry I&#39;ve never had this before either let me finish with this four people get to man me it&#39;s it&#39;s not like oh god this is so gross it&#39;s just like no I just maybe it was too hyped up for me maybe I expected more than what I got now it&#39;s our turn okay so before you do anything we need to first marinate our chicken so to make the marinade you&#39;re gonna combine two cups are 475 millilitres of buttermilk half a tablespoon or 12 grams of gochujang optional 2 teaspoons are 6\"},{\"start\":\"150.25\",\"text\":\"grams of white pepper 1 tablespoon or 8 grams of garlic powder 1 tablespoon or 8 grams of onion powder 1 and 1/2 teaspoons or seven grams of kosher salt and 1 tablespoon or 8 grams of smoked paprika give that some whiskey business until thoroughly combined and depending on how many pieces of chicken you want I&#39;d recommend starting with 2 to 4 chicken breasts cutting those in half like so now look the thickness is pretty different between these two pieces so take the thicker end cover it in some plastic wrap and beat it down until it\"},{\"start\":\"175.72\",\"text\":\"is the same thickness as the other piece no thinner though then just dump those bad boys for the nice little buttermilk bath cover them with plastic wrap and let them marinate for 1 hour at room temperature or overnight in the refrigerator now when you&#39;re ready to actually make this sandwich we need to first start with our buttermilk biscuit this is an important piece make no mistake so in a food processor you&#39;re gonna combine 2 and 3/4 of a cup or 375 grams of all-purpose flour two tablespoons are 26 grams of baking powder and 2/3 of a\"},{\"start\":\"201.94\",\"text\":\"teaspoon or three grams of fine sea salt what&#39;s that a few times in your food processor until thoroughly combined a whiskey business today before you add your butter make sure to measure it and get the exact 140 grams without even trying it just flex on that then cube it up into half inch cubes doesn&#39;t have to be perfect now make sure this butter is really cold if it&#39;s not place it in the freezer for about 5 minutes and then add 2/3 of a cup or 140 grams of cubed very cold butter and pulse it on your food\"},{\"start\":\"225.609\",\"text\":\"processor about 12 to 14 times or until you get little pea-sized balls in there pour that into a bowl and then using a fork you&#39;re then going to mix it in 1 cup or 240 milliliters of butter milk slowly streaming in mixing streaming in and mixing till you&#39;ve added all of your buttermilk and you get a solid mass if it feels a bit dry just add an extra tablespoon or so of buttermilk dump it out onto a work surface gently knead it until it comes together roll it out into a rough rectangle fold it like a letter\"},{\"start\":\"249.519\",\"text\":\"roll it out again lengthwise fold it like a letter again and let it rest in the fridge for about 5 minutes now what&#39;s your toast done taking a nap pull it out lightly flour your work surface and roll it out until you get a rectangle that&#39;s about three quarters of an inch thick then using a three to four inch biscuit cutter cut out many biscuits as you can place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper now look I know you got a lot of excess dough here no problem just bring it back together hold it roughly into a single\"},{\"start\":\"271.53\",\"text\":\"shape roll it back out into a 3/4 of an inch thick rectangle and punch out as many biscuits as you can brush the tops with some extra buttermilk go light here you don&#39;t need to go crazy then place them in an oven set to 425 degrees Fahrenheit for about 15 to 17 minutes or until the tops are golden beautiful Brown

we\"},{\"start\":\"297.66\",\"text\":\"have our elements ready it&#39;s time to fry our chicky first to fill a heavy-bottomed pot with enough fry oil just to go up about two-and-a-half to three inches high make sure you&#39;re not filling it anywhere higher than three-quarters of the way up otherwise you&#39;re risking a fire hazard and I don&#39;t want to get any messages about that sort of thing send it over the stove go ahead and bring that up to about 350 degrees Fahrenheit now while that&#39;s coming up make your dredge by combining two cups\"},{\"start\":\"318.3\",\"text\":\"are 300 grams

some chickie to bread your chicken pull a piece of chicken out of your buttermilk marinade drop it in your flour mixture toss and press\"},{\"start\":\"343.98\",\"text\":\"aggressively to get every single crevice totally hydrated with flour until it&#39;s totally dry shake off the excess and place it to the side now look another thing that you can do is you can drizzle just a little bit of your buttermilk marinade into the flour toss it around so you get little tiny little pieces of clumped up flour in there and then toss your chicken and press in there and you&#39;ll get this little flaky nubs all around the pieces of chicken anyway rinse to repeat with all of your chicken make sure that there&#39;s no wet\"},{\"start\":\"367.11\",\"text\":\"spots on any chicken and once all of your
