Sure, here's a summary of the video:

* The video presents two methods for making breakfast sandwiches: a fancy version and an easy version.
* The fancy version involves making caramelized onions, soft scrambled eggs, spicy mayo, and assembling the sandwich with toasted buns and cheese.
* The easy version involves cooking eggs, ham, and cheese in a single pan with bread that has been soaked in egg.
* The host prefers the fancy version, but acknowledges that the easy version is quicker and easier to make.
* The host mentions that merch is coming soon, including a potential revolutionary apron.
